							{" "}
							My name is Ankit Nayak, and I'm a third-year
							undergraduate student with a passion for full stack
							web development using the MERN stack technology.
							<br />I discovered my love for web development when
							I started building websites for college events and
							student organizations. Since then, I've been
							constantly learning and exploring new libraries and
							frameworks to improve my skills and stay up-to-date
							with the latest technologies. <br />I enjoy building
							projects that challenge me and push my boundaries. I
							believe that every project is an opportunity to
							learn and grow as a developer, and I'm always
							excited to take on new challenges.
							<br /> In my free time, I love to read about new web
							development trends and technologies, and experiment
							with new libraries to implement in my projects. I
							also enjoy collaborating with other developers and
							contributing to open source projects. <br />
